## Purpose
I built this to learn React fundamentals of reuseable components, routing and props. 

It was also my introduction to a NoSQL database, specifically Firebase. I learned how to use CRUD methods on these documents. 

Additionally, I refined HTML skills: flexbox, margin, padding, sticky elements, skeleton loading.

The actualy booking system is still to be continued.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **React**: First "big" project using React for routing between homepage, a user page and a listing. I learned how to work in a component-focused manner. 
- **Data** structure: Learned what is necessary and how to structure the data of a listing. This way the app can be easily extended  by users (adding listings, comments etc) as well as interactions between users.
- **Firebase** (NoSql): CRUD methods on documents
- **GoogleMaps API**: Coordinates from a listing will pinpoint location on GoogleMaps
- **CSS**: Flexbox, grid, organize CSS based on components, i.e. limit name clashing
